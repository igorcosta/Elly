My wife decided to learn English, so this App is to help her and many more.

### The story
Ely it's my wife and she decided to learn English, like any immigrant that goes to countries like US, CAN, NZ, AUS,UK.
To help her, I designed and developed this app and since I'm passion about open-source and knowing that there are lots
and lots of people struggling to learn English, here's my little contribution for those.

In 2015 we moved to New Zealand all the way from Brazil and we're really enjoying the time here.
At the same time she's struggling to learn English, so to help her I've developed this Mobile App that works for iOS and Android.

It's like she uses this app as her conversational Swiss Army Knife.

### Method applied

None. let's Kids while learning a new language they learn by experience, listening and doing so.

Ely, learns pretty quick when she listen or see a picture and I think that most humans have this photography memory approach. Don't tell me that you don't have, because you're lying, you can recognize your mom's face? If your answer is *YES*, so you can.

### Technologies used.

 The goal was simple, how to create a smart tool for such a lovely girl in a short time?

  - Javascript with ReactJS skills.
  - NodeJS
  - Yarn  _for managing dependencies_
  - React Native  _to build the version for iOS and Android_

### APIs connected
[Oxford Dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation)

[Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

[Google Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/)



### Costs

   It's open-source, but this comes with a price, since I relay on public API like Google, Oxford, there's a limit of REST calls, so you need to setup your account to use your own API_SECRET and API_ID.

### Prototype
  I designed the app using Adobe XD tool, you can sign up for an Adobe Creative Cloud Account to modify my design. It's cheap compared to the benefits that tool provides.
